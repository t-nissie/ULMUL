= ULMUL (Ultra Lightweight MarkUp Language)
"ULMUL" is an original Ultra Lightweight MarkUp Language.
ULMUL texts can be converted into HTML5 with "ulmul2html5"
command and into LaTeX with "ulmul2latex" command.
TeX style equations are converted into MathML.
ULMUL is written in Ruby.
You can also use ulmul.rb as a library.

Homepage of ULMUL: http://ulmul.rubyforge.org/

Download ULMUL from: http://rubygems.org/gems/ulmul or http://rubyforge.org/projects/ulmul

== Features
 * TeX style equations between two dollar marks ($) and between \Eq:foo and /Eq:foo
   will be converted into MathML. You can use Firefox4, IE9, etc. to read MathML.
 * ulmul2html5 output is good with the Slidy presentation environment
   http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy/ using Firefox+CSS+XHTML+JavaScript.
   Please use ulmul-slidy.js and ulmul-slidy.css in the package.
 * Figures, tables and code can be inserted to the document.
   They can be easily refered in the text.
 * Lines starting from "#" are comments.
 * You can add your conversion rules to @subs_rules.
 * "Table of Contents" will be automatically generated.
 * "= ABC EFGH" will be the document title and the cover page of Slidy.
 * Use utf-8 for ULMUL texts.
   Specify your natural language with a --language option, e.g. --language=en.

== Installation of ULMUL
Please use gem ( RubyGems https://rubygems.org/ ) for the installation.
  $ sudo gem install ulmul
If you do not have the eim_xml, math_ml, aasm and exifr libraries,
gem will download and install the libraries automatically.

== How to write ULMUL texts
The encode of input file must be utf-8.
=== lines
Inside ulmul.rb, input lines are processed as "events"
with aasm library https://rubygems.org/gems/aasm .
==== empty
Empty lines divide paragraphs.
==== heading
Starting with "= ", "== ", "=== ", "==== ", "===== ", and "====== ".
"= " will be used for the title.
==== asterisk
Lines starting with asterisks become itemizing list.
For example,
 # Nesting is allowed uo to 5th level.
  * First
    * Second
      * Third
        * Fourth
        * more for Fourth
      second continue
      * More for third
  * More for first
become
# Nesting is allowed uo to 5th level.
 * First
   * Second
     * Third
       * Fourth
       * more for Fourth
     second continue
     * More for third
 * More for first
==== offset
Lines starting with some spaces but not asterisks become verbatim lines.
==== end
EOF or "=end" end the process.
==== ignore
Lines starting with "#" and "=begin" are ignored.
==== normal
Other lines.
=== Other rules
 * Lines after "=end" are ignored.
 * Add your substitution rules to @subs_rules.
=== Equations
Input:
 Mass $m$ can be converted into energy $E$ as
 \Eq:Emc2
            E=mc^2.
 /Eq:Emc2

Output:

Mass $m$ can be converted into energy $E$ as
\Eq:Emc2
           E=mc^2.
/Eq:Emc2

To view the equations in MathML correctly, please use
 * Firefox 4 http://mozilla.jp/firefox/
 * IE9
 * etc.

=== Figures
Start a Figure environment with "\Fig:foo FILENAME.jpg"
and terminate it with "/Fig:foo", where "foo" is a tag for the figure.
You can write a figure caption between them.
You can refer the figure with "Fig:foo" as Fig:ruby.

Input:
 \Fig:ruby ruby.jpg
   The is a dummy figure for an example.
   Cute red logo of Ruby, isn't it?
 /Fig:ruby

Output:
\Fig:ruby ruby.jpg
  The is a dummy figure for an example.
  Cute red logo of Ruby, isn't it?
/Fig:ruby

=== Tables
Table environment is NOT IMPLEMENTED yet.
Start a Table environment with "\Table:bar"
and terminate it with "/Table:bar", where "bar" is a tag for the table.
You can write a figure caption between them.
You can refer the figure with "Table:bar" as Table:diamond.

Input:
 \Table:diamond
   The is a dummy caption for the table.
 /Table:diamond

Output:
\Table:diamond
  The is a dummy caption for the table.
/Table:diamond

=== Code
Start a Code environment with "\Code:baz FILENAME"
and terminate it with "/Code:baz", where "baz" is a tag for the code.
You can write a figure caption between them.
You can refer the figure with "Code:baz" as Code:hello.
Code will be highlighted with
google-code-prettify http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/ ,
when options of -s google-code-prettify/src/prettify.css and
-j google-code-prettify/src/prettify.js are given.

Input:
 \Code:hello hello.c
   Ordinary hello.c.
   Can you see stdio.h?
 /Code:hello

Output:
\Code:hello hello.c
  Ordinary hello.c.
  Can you see stdio.h?
/Code:hello

== Usage of ulmul2html5
=== Examples
 $ ulmul2html5 foo.txt > foo.html
 $ ulmul2html5 -n 'Takeshi Nishimatsu' -s ulmul-slidy.css -j ulmul-slidy.js presentation.txt > presentation.html

=== Command options
==== --help
Show a help message.
==== -s, --style
Specify stylesheet filename.
==== -n, --name
Specify your name for copyright notices.

=== ULMUL and Slidy examples
 * http://loto.sourceforge.net/feram/
   * Its source is http://loto.sourceforge.net/feram/README
 * http://loto.sourceforge.net/feram/doc/film.xhtml
   * It is a Slidy presentation made from http://loto.sourceforge.net/feram/doc/film.txt
 * http://ulmul.rubyforge.org/index.en.html
   * Its source is http://ulmul.rubyforge.org/README-en (this document)

=== ulmul2xhtml is obsolete
ulmul2xhtml will be removed from next version 0.6.x.

== Usage of ulmul2latex
 $ ulmul2latex --help
 $ ulmul2latex test.ulmul | tee test.tex
 $ latex test.tex
 $ latex test.tex
 $ dvipdfmx test.dvi
ulmul2latex is still under development. Sorry.

== TODO
 * More usefull error messages for syntax errors.
 * Unit test, tests/ulmul_test.rb
 * @body shoud be XML object, not a String.
 * Citation.
For more, see TODO file.

== Subversion repository
