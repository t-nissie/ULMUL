= ULMUL (Ultra Lightweight MarkUp Language)
"ULMUL" is an original Ultra Lightweight MarkUp Language.
ULMUL can be converted into HTML5 with "ulmul2html5" command
and into XHTML with "ulmul2xhtml" command. TeX stile
equations are converted into MathML. ULMUL is written in Ruby.
You can also use ulmul.rb as a lirary.

Homepage of ULMUL: http://ulmul.rubyforge.org/

Download ULMUL from: http://rubyforge.org/projects/ulmul or http://rubygems.org/gems/ulmul


== Features
 * Equations between two dollar marks ($) and Eq.

== How can I install ULMUL?
There are two different ways to install ULMUL.
=== I. Conservative way; use setup.rb
ulmul-X.Y.Z.tgz package can be installed as:
  $ tar zxf ulmul-X.Y.Z.tgz
  $ cd ulmul-X.Y.Z
  $ su
  # ruby setup.rb
Note that the eimxml and mathml libraries are required.
=== II. RubyGems users can take an easy way
There is an easy way, if you are a RubyGems user:
  $ su
  # gem install ulmul
If you do not have the eimxml and mathml libraries, gem will download and install the
library automatically.

=== Files
 * ulmul.rb         Ruby script.
 * slidy.js         JavaScript for Slidy. Slightly modified from the original.
 * ulmul-slidy.cssã€€CSS file for Slidy.  Largely modified from the original.
 * style.css        Example CSS file for normal web pages.
If you installed ULMUL with gem, you may find these files in
/usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/ulmul-X.Y.Z/
or    /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/ulmul-X.Y.Z/ .

== How can I write a ULMUL text?
The encode of input file must be utf-8.
=== Events (each input line)
==== empty
Empty lines devide paragraphs.
==== heading
Starting with "= ", "== ", "=== ", "==== ", "===== ", and "====== ".
"= " will be used for the title.
==== asterisk
Lines starting with
 " *"
 "   *"
 "     *"
 "       *"
 "         *"
become itemize.
==== offset
Lines starting with some spaces but not asterisks become verbatim lines.
==== end
EOF or "=end" end the process.
==== ignore
Lines starting with"#" and "=begin" are ignored.
==== normal
Other lines.
=== Other rules
 * Lines after "=end" are ignored.
 * Add your substitution rules to @subs_rules.
=== Equations
Input:
 Mass $m$ can be converted into energy $E$ as
 Eq. 1
            E=mc^2.
 /Eq.

Output:

Mass $m$ can be converted into energy $E$ as
Eq. 1
            E=mc^2.
/Eq.

=== Figures
Input:
 Fig. 1 ruby.jpg
   The is a dummy figure for an example.
 /Fig.

Output:
Fig. 1 ruby.jpg
  The is a dummy figure for an example.
  Cute red logo of Ruby, isn't it?
/Fig.


== Usage
=== Examples
 $ ulmul2xhtml without-equations.txt > without-equations.html   # XHTML1.0 Transitional
 $ ulmul2xhtml with-equations.txt    > with-equations.html      # XHTML1.1 + MathML2.0
 $ ulmul2xhtml -n 'Takeshi Nishimatsu' -s ulmul-slidy.css -j slidy.js presentation.txt > presentation.xhtml
 $ ulmul2html5 with-equations.txt    > with-equations.html      # HTML5

=== Command options
==== -s, --style
